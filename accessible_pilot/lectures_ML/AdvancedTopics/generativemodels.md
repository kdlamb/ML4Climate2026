# Generative Models and Uncertainty

The deep learning architectures we have seen so far, the
[artificial neural network](../DeepLearning/ann.md), the
[convolutional neural network](../DeepLearning/cnn.md), and the
[recurrent neural network](../DeepLearning/rnn.md), are all *discriminative*:
given an input, they predict a single output. This page begins the Advanced
Topics unit with **generative modeling**, where a model instead predicts a
*distribution* of possible outputs. We will:

- Define **generative modeling** and contrast it with what we have seen before.
- Distinguish **aleatoric** from **epistemic** uncertainty.
- Survey the main ways of **adding uncertainty** to machine learning models.
- Learn to **evaluate** uncertainty estimates, with the spread vs. skill plot
  and the **continuous ranked probability score (CRPS)**.

The [next page](gansdiffusion.md) covers two state-of-the-art generative
architectures, GANs and diffusion models, and the [page after that](vaes.md)
covers a third, the variational autoencoder, together with the scientific uses
of its latent representations.

On the standard site this is a Jupyter notebook whose figures are generated
from a few lines of `numpy` and `scikit-learn`. Here the same code is given as

## Why include uncertainty?

Consider a downscaling problem from the satellite literature (Leinonen et al.
2020). We observe a *low resolution* satellite image of rain rates: each coarse
pixel averages over many fine ones, so information about the small scale
structure has been lost. Now we ask a machine learning model to reconstruct the
*high resolution* rain field. There is no longer a single right answer: many
different fine scale fields would average to exactly the same coarse image, and
the low resolution input does not contain enough information to discriminate
between them.

A model trained to output one answer must collapse all of those possibilities
onto a single field. **Without including uncertainty, machine learning models
can be overconfident in their predictions**: the one field they return may look
plausible while being far from the truth, and nothing in the output warns us.
What we would rather have is the *distribution* of rain fields consistent with
the input. An ensemble of samples from that distribution tells us what the
probable rain rates are, and how much they could vary.

That is what a generative model is: a statistical model that predicts a **joint
probability distribution** over its variables, so that given an input $x$ it
can return a conditional distribution $p(y \mid x)$ (read: the probability of
output $y$ given input $x$) rather than a single output vector $y$.

## Two kinds of uncertainty

Machine learning distinguishes two sources of uncertainty (Abdar et al. 2021):

- **Aleatoric uncertainty** is the irreducible scatter in the system itself,
  for example measurement noise, or true stochasticity in the process. No
  amount of extra data removes it.
- **Epistemic uncertainty** comes from not having seen enough data. Where we
  have few or no observations, many different models fit equally well. More
  measurements *can* reduce it.

The distinction matters because the two call for different remedies: a
generative model can learn to *represent* the aleatoric spread, but only more
observations (or an honest admission of ignorance) address the epistemic part.
The toy example below makes both visible.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)

def truth(x):
    return np.sin(x)

# noisy observations of a sine wave, with a gap between x = 4 and x = 6
x_obs = rng.uniform(0, 10, 150)
x_obs = x_obs[(x_obs < 4) | (x_obs > 6)]
y_obs = truth(x_obs) + 0.25 * rng.standard_normal(len(x_obs))

xg = np.linspace(0, 10, 400)
plt.figure(figsize=(7, 3.5))
plt.axvspan(4, 6, color="0.92", label="no observations (epistemic)")
plt.plot(xg, truth(xg), "k", lw=1.5, label="true signal")
plt.scatter(x_obs, y_obs, s=12, alpha=0.6, label="noisy observations (aleatoric)")
plt.xlabel("x"); plt.ylabel("y"); plt.legend(loc="upper right", fontsize=8)
plt.title("Aleatoric scatter vs. an epistemic gap")
plt.tight_layout(); plt.show()
```

:::{admonition} What the plot shows
A sine curve runs from x = 0 to x = 10, with about 120 scattered observation
points around it. The points miss the curve vertically by about 0.25 on
average: that scatter is the aleatoric uncertainty. Between x = 4 and x = 6 a
shaded band marks a region with no observations at all: that is the epistemic
gap. The curve keeps oscillating inside the band, but nothing in the data says
so.
:::

The vertical scatter of the points around the curve is the aleatoric
uncertainty: even with infinite data, single observations would still miss the
curve by about the noise level. The gap is epistemic: a model is free to do
almost anything across it. Measuring inside the gap would shrink that
uncertainty; measuring more outside it would not.

## Ways to add uncertainty to a neural network

In practice there are several ways to make a network produce a distribution
instead of a point estimate (Haynes et al. 2023). None is universally best; they
trade training cost, inference cost, and how much of the uncertainty they
capture.

1. **Learn the ensemble directly.** Train one network to output $K$ target
   values instead of one, so the model learns an ensemble prediction in a
   single forward pass. This needs ground truth ensembles (or a lot of data).
2. **Multi-model ensembles.** Train several independent networks that differ
   only in their random initialization (and the randomness of optimization).
   Their predictions disagree most where the data constrain them least, so the
   spread across members estimates epistemic uncertainty. This is often called
   a *deep ensemble*.
3. **Predict distribution parameters.** If the target is plausibly Gaussian,
   let the network output the mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$
   rather than $y$; more complex parametric distributions work the same way.
4. **Predict summary statistics.** Instead of the parameters, output a set of
   *quantiles* of the target distribution.
5. **Monte Carlo dropout.** Dropout randomly zeroes a fraction of weights in
   each layer. During training this regularizes the model. If we *keep dropout
   on during inference*, every forward pass uses a slightly different
   subnetwork, so repeating the prediction many times yields a spread of
   outputs: uncertainty quantification almost for free.

Below we build a small deep ensemble (option 2) on the toy data: ten identical
networks that differ only in `random_state`. To see where the members disagree,
we also ask them to predict past $x = 10$, beyond the last observation.

```python
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor

X = x_obs.reshape(-1, 1)
ensemble = [
    MLPRegressor(hidden_layer_sizes=(50, 50), activation="relu",
                 max_iter=4000, random_state=s).fit(X, y_obs)
    for s in range(10)
]
xg = np.linspace(0, 14, 560)        # extends past the last observation at x = 10
preds = np.array([m.predict(xg.reshape(-1, 1)) for m in ensemble])
ens_mean, ens_spread = preds.mean(axis=0), preds.std(axis=0)

plt.figure(figsize=(7, 3.5))
plt.axvspan(4, 6, color="0.92")
plt.axvspan(10, 14, color="0.85")
plt.plot(xg, truth(xg), "k", lw=1.5, label="true signal")
plt.plot(xg, preds.T, color="tab:orange", lw=0.6, alpha=0.5)
plt.plot(xg, ens_mean, color="tab:red", lw=2, label="ensemble mean")
plt.fill_between(xg, ens_mean - 2 * ens_spread, ens_mean + 2 * ens_spread,
                 color="tab:red", alpha=0.15, label="mean ± 2 spread")
plt.scatter(x_obs, y_obs, s=8, alpha=0.4)
plt.xlabel("x"); plt.ylabel("y"); plt.legend(loc="upper left", fontsize=8)
plt.title("A deep ensemble: 10 networks, different initializations")
plt.tight_layout(); plt.show()

gap = (xg > 4) & (xg < 6)
beyond = xg > 10
data_region = ~gap & ~beyond
print(f"mean ensemble spread where we have data:  {ens_spread[data_region].mean():.3f}")
print(f"mean ensemble spread in the interior gap: {ens_spread[gap].mean():.3f}")
print(f"mean ensemble spread beyond x = 10:       {ens_spread[beyond].mean():.3f}")
```

:::{admonition} What the plot shows
Ten thin lines, one per trained network, follow the sine wave closely wherever
observations exist. Between x = 4 and x = 6 (the interior gap) the lines
bridge the gap in nearly the same way, staying close together, even though the
true curve dips to its minimum there. Beyond x = 10, where the data end, the
ten lines fan out dramatically, some rising and some falling, and the shaded
"mean ± 2 spread" band widens to cover most of the plot height.

The printed numbers: mean spread is 0.213 where we have data, 0.186 in the
interior gap, and 0.635 beyond x = 10, about three times larger.
:::

Beyond the edge of the data the members fan out dramatically, each
extrapolating in its own direction: the spread past $x = 10$ is about three
times the spread over the observed region. The ensemble has *discovered* its
own epistemic uncertainty there, without ever being told where the data end.

The interior gap teaches a subtler lesson. The members bridge it in nearly the
same way, so the spread there is *no larger* than where we have data, even
though the truth (which keeps oscillating) is far from all of them. With data
on both sides, every network interpolates similarly and the ensemble stays
confidently wrong. Deep ensembles reveal epistemic uncertainty most reliably
under extrapolation; they can remain overconfident when interpolating across a
gap, which is worth remembering whenever an ensemble looks reassuringly tight.

## Evaluating predicted distributions: spread vs. skill

Once a model outputs distributions, evaluation has to change too. A first
diagnostic borrowed from ensemble weather forecasting is the **spread vs.
skill plot**:

- **Spread** is the uncertainty across ensemble members (their standard
  deviation).
- **Skill** is the accuracy of the ensemble mean (its absolute error).

For a well calibrated ensemble the two should match on average: when the
ensemble claims a spread of 0.2, the mean should typically be wrong by about
0.2. Plotting binned skill against spread, a reliable ensemble follows the
one-to-one line. Points **above** the line (error larger than spread) mean the
ensemble is *overconfident*, or under-dispersive: it does not capture the true
range of outcomes. Points **below** it mean the ensemble is *underconfident*.
The plot answers two questions at once: does the ensemble capture the range of
possible outcomes, and is the ensemble mean a reliable prediction?

An operational spread vs. skill plot aggregates over thousands of forecasts;
here we only have the one toy problem, so we bin the 560 grid points by their
ensemble spread and compare the average spread to the average error in each
bin.

```python
err = np.abs(ens_mean - truth(xg))

# bin points by ensemble spread and compare mean spread to mean error per bin
bins = np.quantile(ens_spread, np.linspace(0, 1, 9))
which = np.digitize(ens_spread, bins[1:-1])
bin_spread = np.array([ens_spread[which == b].mean() for b in range(8)])
bin_err = np.array([err[which == b].mean() for b in range(8)])

plt.figure(figsize=(4.5, 4.5))
lim = max(bin_spread.max(), bin_err.max()) * 1.1
plt.plot([0, lim], [0, lim], "k--", lw=1, label="perfect calibration")
plt.plot(bin_spread, bin_err, "o-", color="tab:red")
plt.xlabel("ensemble spread (binned)"); plt.ylabel("error of ensemble mean")
plt.title("Spread vs. skill"); plt.legend(fontsize=8)
plt.tight_layout(); plt.show()

print(f"correlation between spread and error: {np.corrcoef(ens_spread, err)[0, 1]:.2f}")
```

:::{admonition} What the plot shows
Eight connected points compare binned ensemble spread (horizontal axis) to the
average error of the ensemble mean (vertical axis), with a dashed one-to-one
diagonal for reference. The first seven points rise from roughly (spread 0.10,
error 0.27) to (spread 0.53, error 0.95): larger spread does mean larger
error. Every point sits above the diagonal, so the error is always bigger than
the spread claims. The final point breaks the trend, dropping back down to
(spread 0.82, error 0.52). The printed correlation between spread and error is
0.29.
:::

Through most of the range, bins with larger spread have larger error: spread is
doing its job as a predictor of error. Two honest caveats are visible too.
First, every bin sits *above* the one-to-one line, meaning the error is
consistently larger than the spread claims: the ensemble is under-dispersive,
or overconfident, a very common finding for deep ensembles, whose members
(differing only in initialization) rarely fan out as widely as the true range
of possibilities. Second, the largest spread bin breaks the trend: at extreme
extrapolation the members fan out so symmetrically that their mean lands near
the middle by construction, and with a single toy realization these statistics
are noisy anyway. Diagnostics like this one are only trustworthy when averaged
over many cases.

## The continuous ranked probability score

Spread vs. skill diagnoses calibration, but we also want a single score to
*compare* probabilistic models, the way MAE or MSE compares deterministic
ones. The standard choice is the **continuous ranked probability score**:

$$\mathrm{CRPS}(F, y) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}
\left( F(z) - \mathbb{1}\{z \ge y\} \right)^2 \, dz$$

In words: take the forecast's cumulative distribution function $F$ (the
probability that the outcome is less than or equal to each value $z$), and
take the step function that is 0 below the observed value $y$ and jumps to 1
at it. The CRPS is the integral over all $z$ of the squared difference between
the two. A sharp forecast centered on the observation makes that area small,
so **lower CRPS is better**. If the forecast is a single deterministic value,
its CDF is itself a step function and the CRPS **reduces exactly to the mean
absolute error**, which is what makes it a genuine generalization of the
deterministic metrics we already use.

```python
def crps_from_samples(samples, y, zgrid):
    "CRPS of an empirical (ensemble) forecast, by numerical integration."
    F = (np.sort(samples)[:, None] <= zgrid[None, :]).mean(axis=0)
    H = (zgrid >= y).astype(float)
    return np.trapz((F - H) ** 2, zgrid)

# evaluate at one point beyond the data, where the members disagree
x0 = 12.0
i0 = np.argmin(np.abs(xg - x0))
members = preds[:, i0]
y0 = truth(x0)
zg = np.linspace(-5, 5, 4001)

F = (np.sort(members)[:, None] <= zg[None, :]).mean(axis=0)
H = (zg >= y0).astype(float)

plt.figure(figsize=(6, 3.5))
plt.plot(zg, F, label="forecast CDF (ensemble)")
plt.plot(zg, H, "k", label="observation (step)")
plt.fill_between(zg, F, H, alpha=0.2, label="area that CRPS penalizes")
plt.xlim(-2.5, 2.5); plt.xlabel("z"); plt.ylabel("cumulative probability")
plt.title(f"CRPS at x = {x0}"); plt.legend(fontsize=8)
plt.tight_layout(); plt.show()

crps_ens = crps_from_samples(members, y0, zg)
det = members[0]                       # a single deterministic forecast
crps_det = crps_from_samples(np.array([det]), y0, zg)
print(f"observation y = {y0:.3f}")
print(f"CRPS of the 10-member ensemble:      {crps_ens:.3f}")
print(f"CRPS of a single member:             {crps_det:.3f}")
print(f"|error| of that member (MAE check):  {abs(det - y0):.3f}")
```

:::{admonition} What the plot shows
The ensemble's cumulative distribution rises in ten small steps from 0 to 1 as
z goes from about -1 to about 1.3 (the range the ten members span at x = 12).
The observation's step function jumps from 0 to 1 at y = -0.537. The shaded
region between the two curves is the area the CRPS adds up.

The printed numbers: the 10-member ensemble scores CRPS 0.436; a single member
scores 0.817, and that member's absolute error is also 0.817, identical to its
CRPS.
:::

The printed numbers make both claims of the previous section concrete. First,
the CRPS of the single deterministic member equals its absolute error (up to
the resolution of the integration grid): CRPS really does reduce to MAE in the
deterministic case. Second, at this point beyond the data, where the members
genuinely disagree, the ensemble scores markedly better than the single
member: spreading probability over the plausible range is rewarded when any
one point prediction is likely to be off.

## Summary

- Generative models predict **distributions of outputs** rather than single
  vectors, which lets them express uncertainty instead of hiding it.
- **Aleatoric** uncertainty is irreducible scatter; **epistemic** uncertainty
  reflects missing data and can be reduced by observing more.
- Practical routes to uncertainty: learned ensembles, deep ensembles,
  predicted distribution parameters, predicted quantiles, and Monte Carlo
  dropout.
- Evaluate probabilistic predictions with **spread vs. skill** for calibration
  and **CRPS** for scoring; CRPS generalizes MAE.

The [next page](gansdiffusion.md) introduces the first two of three
state-of-the-art generative architectures: generative adversarial networks and
diffusion models.
